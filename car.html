            <h1>1- Sedan</h1>
            <p>A Sedan is a type of car in which the cargo area is behind the rear pillars. It is separated from the
                cabin
                where the
                passengers are seated. Sedans offer great protection for the cargo against theft since they don’t have
                glass
                windows in the cargo area.

            <h1>2-Pickup</h1>
            <p>A pickup is one of the most recognizable cars in the world. It is distinguishable from other automobiles
                due
                to
                its
                distinct design. Its cargo space is completely divided from its cabin space and it usually seats no more
                than 3
                or 4
                individuals at a time.

            <h1>3- Jeep</h1>
            <p>Jeep is like Kleenex. It’s a product model that’s become synonymous with an entire product line. Jeep, as
                a
                model, is
                designed and built by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The Jeep hit the scene in November 1940, just before
                the
                USA
                entered
                WWII. They were widely used throughout the war and subsequent wars due to their ability to travel on all
                kinds
                of
                terrain.

        <div class="container">
            <h1>4- Coupe</h1>
            <p>A coupe is a car that is defined by simplicity. It has two doors, a small cargo space, and takes its cues
                from
                both the
                Sedan and the Hatchback. It has minimal space and is a minimalist car that is designed to impress. It
                isn’t
                for
                the
                family or for a get together of friends. It’s for the lone rider or a couple that wants to explore the
                world.

        <div class="container">
            <h1>5- Convertible</h1>
            <p>Does the roof retract into the body leaving the passenger cabin open to the elements? If so, it's a
                convertible. Most
                convertibles have a fully powered fabric roof that folds down, but a few have to be lowered by hand.
                There
                are also a
                number of models with a retractable hardtop, as well as several unusual quasi-convertibles (called
                "targa
                tops") like
                the Mazda MX-5 Miata RF, Porsche 911 Targa and Corvette; only the forward section of their roofs
                retracts or
                can be
                removed by hand.
